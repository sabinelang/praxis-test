The Digital Museum: As the access to digital data (including images) becomes easier and widely available, possibilities for museums to use this data also increase. Virtual exhibitions present art works of various artists or one single artist according to a theme. Because of it being accessible online, it can reach far more people than real-life exhibitions. Also, the virtual exhibition can be enriched with many more info as it may contains links to other websites and further applications.

Digitization: Digitization was one key word in previous years. Cultural institutions, such as museums, libraries or archives digitized their data, so that users can access it from all over the world from the comfort of their homes. Art historical data is thus widely available and interactive, as it can be shared by many people. Digitized data provides the basis for digital art history; what has to be considered before digitizing data? What are the challenges? And is there too much data?
